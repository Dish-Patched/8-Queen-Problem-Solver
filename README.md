# 8-Queen Problem Solver

Developed a Python program to solve the classic 8-Queens problem using both Hill Climbing and Random Restart Hill Climbing algorithms.

- Utilized heuristics to efficiently search for conflict-free board configurations
- Visualized board states and algorithm steps for debugging and analysis
